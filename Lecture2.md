## Performance
* Execution time performance: ET = IC * CPI * CT
  * IC: instruction count
  * CPI: cycles per instruction (average)
  * CT: cycle time; seconds per cycle
    * CT = 1 / IC
    * 1Hz = 1 second per cycle
## Operations
* Load word (reads from memory, writes to registers)
* Store word (reads from registers, writes to memory)
* Branch instructions
