# Chapter 1
## Response Time and Throughput
* Response time = how long it takes to do a task
* Throughput = work done per unit time
### Relative Performance
* `Performance = 1 / Execution Time`
* "X is n times faster than Y" means:
  * `Performance_X / Performance_Y = ExecutionTime_X / ExecutionTime_Y = n`
