* Applications, compiler, OS sits on ISA (instruction set architecture) layer
* Instruction set architecture
  * Instructions: add, multiply accumulator
  * Registers
* Micro architecture sits under ISA
  * Area: silicon real estate increasing over time
  * Power / heat
  * Wires: as feature size decreases, wires must be made thinner and taller; capacitance becomes an issue
  * Performance
  * Security
* Physicial design under micro architecture
* Chip
  * Memory
  * Functional units
* Feature size: distance of components from one another
  * Lower is faster; bottleneck is heat, solution is heatsink
## Quarter Overview
* Performance
* ISA
* ALU - arithmetic logic unit
* Datapath + control
* Pipelining
* Caches
