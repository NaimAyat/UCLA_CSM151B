# Intro
* Goal: connect multiple computers to get higher performance
  * Multiprocessors
  * Scalability, availibility, power efficiency
* Job-level (process-level) paralellism
  * High throughput for independent jobs
* Parallel processing program
  * Single program run on multiple processors
* Multicore microprocessors
  * Chips with multiple processors (core)
## Parallel Programming
* Parallel software is the problem
* Need to get significant performance improvement
  * Otherwise, just use a faster uniprocessor, since it's easier
* Difficulties
  * Partitioning
  * Coordination
  * Communications overhead
